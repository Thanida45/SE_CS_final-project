### Abstract
An authentication is a crucial method for Smartphone systems. There are several authentication methods, the popular and widespread method is a text-based password. However, the main problem of text-based password sometime is the difficulty of remembering passwords. Researchers have attempted to seek for non-text password which can yield better usability and security, to design an effective authentication in terms of usability and security. 

For design authentication method, the graphical password is generated. This project is concerning design with face password in face password generator(Application). Some images are composed a face password and conducted the experiment measure the performance of applications about satisfy with the system and the safety of theft by face-password. Before the development is survey detail factor such the creation by password and graphical password, The information design graphical password. According to the face password development on the Smartphone, a user needs to generat a password and login to test the generated password. 

There is experimental group of 13 participants for register and access systems(login). The security is for measurment and satisfaction on usability. The result experiment indicated that user generated a face password on the grid has an great impact to usability and security on the iOS operating system. Users are still satisfied in the developed system.
